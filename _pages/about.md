# About Me

## Education
**Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2017-2021 expected)**
+ I am currently a junior undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
+ I am a member of IEEE honor class, an elite student program in the School of Electronics, Information and Electrical Engineering.
+ I am also admitted to Zhiyuan College, joining in Zhiyuan Honors Program in Engineering.
+ I am registered as a student member of IEEE.

## Research 
+ My research interests lie in the general area of Natural Language Processing. Previously, my focus was on Dialogue State Tracking and Text-To-SQL Dialogue Systems.
+ I am also interested in Human-Computer Interaction. Specifically, strategies and actions dialogue bots take to interact with human.
