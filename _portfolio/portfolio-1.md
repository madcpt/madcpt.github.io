Welcome to our <b>Oral Paper</b> in [NLPCC 2020](http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2020/)!

What we include in this work:

+ A novel Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking algorithm using BERT to encode information from dialogue context and Gated End-to-End Memory Network to help generate machine response

+ Empirical results on benchmark MultiWoZ 2.1 overwhelmed previous state-of-the-art algorithm by approximate 2%

+ We also replace the RNN module with Transformers and achieved improvements in efficiency
